    <p>I studied painting at the College of Creative Studies in Santa Barbara. Unsatisfied with the lack of skills-based training in art school, I studied classics at Thomas Aquinas College. After graduating, I was a monk in a number if different monasteries (in Portugal, Brazil, Massachussettes, South Dakota, and Nova Scotia) for 15 years. I lived as a hermit for about 5 years in Colorado and Vermont. Discovering icon painting lead me back into art. I have been an artist and teacher for the past decade.</p>
